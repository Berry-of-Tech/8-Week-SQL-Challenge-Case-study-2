# Introduction

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

# Problem Statement

Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.

So he prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

# Recommendations

There were 2 cancellations, one by the restaurant, and the other by the customer, it should be look into to prevent it from happening again

It may be difficult to find out why the customer cancelled, but the restaurant should put a cancellation policy in place that protects all parties, i.e. restaurant, customers, and runners.

What caused delay in the preparation and delivery of order number 8?, it had only 1 pizza, and a much higher preparation time than other orders containing just 1 pizza. What caused it, How can it be prevented 

It is important to take user ratings and feedback seriously for businesses to gain credibility

To better maximize profits, Danny could look into his overall operations cost.

Are the pizza and delivery prices right? Taking note of what is leftover after paying runners

# Conclusion

The Pizza Runner HQ seems to be doing fairly well for a new business. There are lot of areas to explore and look into from a business perspective. So i hope my recommendation will help Danny to grow is business.
