# Question

If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? 
Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

# Solution
--insert the new pizza name and id into the pizza_names table

```sql
INSERT INTO pizza_names (pizza_id, pizza_name)
VALUES (3, 'Supreme');

SELECT *
FROM pizza_names
```
  pizza_id  | pizza_name
:----------:|:------------:
  1         | Meatlovers
  2         | Vegetarian
  3         | Supreme

--insert the pizza ingredients into the pizza_recipes tables

  ```sql
WITH new_pizza_id AS 
(SELECT pizza_id
FROM pizza_names
WHERE pizza_name = 'Supreme')
INSERT INTO pizza_recipes (pizza_id, toppings)
SELECT (SELECT pizza_id 
		FROM new_pizza_id), STRING_AGG(pt.topping_id::text, ', ')
FROM pizza_toppings AS pt;


SELECT *
FROM pizza_recipes

```
  pizza_id  | toppings
:----------:|:-----------:
  1         | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10
  2         | 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12
  3         | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11,12
