# Recommendations

There were 2 cancellations, one by the restaurant, and the other by the customer, it should be look into to prevent it from happening again

It may be difficult to find out why the customer cancelled, but the restaurant should put a cancellation policy in place that protects all parties, i.e. restaurant, customers, and runners.

What caused delay in the preparation and delivery of order number 8?, it had only 1 pizza, and a much higher preparation time than other orders containing just 1 pizza. What caused it, How can it be prevented

It is important to take user ratings and feedback seriously for businesses to gain credibility

To better maximize profits, Danny could look into his overall operations cost.

Are the pizza and delivery prices right? Taking note of what is leftover after paying runners

# Conclusion

The Pizza Runner HQ seems to be doing fairly well for a new business. There are lot of areas to explore and look into from a business perspective. 
So i hope my recommendation will help Danny to grow is business.
