# Solution
## Creating Temp Tables

-- Create a temp table clean_extras to separate extras with delimiter into multiple rows
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_extras;

CREATE TEMP TABLE clean_extras AS
SELECT c.record_id, 
		CAST(TRIM(e.extras) AS INTEGER) AS extra_id
FROM customer_orders AS c
LEFT JOIN LATERAL UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(c.extras,',')) AS e(extras) ON TRUE;


SELECT *
FROM clean_extras
```

-- Create a temp table clean_exclusions to separate exclusions with delimiter into multiple rows
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_exclusions;

CREATE TEMP TABLE clean_exclusions AS
SELECT c.record_id, CAST(TRIM(e.exclusions) AS INTEGER) AS exclusions_id
FROM customer_orders AS c
LEFT JOIN LATERAL UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(c.exclusions,',')) AS e(exclusions) ON TRUE;

SELECT *
FROM clean_exclusions
```

--Create a temp table clean_toppings to separate toppings into multiple rows
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_toppings;

CREATE TEMP TABLE clean_toppings AS
SELECT
  pr.pizza_id,
  TRIM(t.value) :: INTEGER AS topping_id,
  pt.topping_name
FROM
  pizza_recipes AS pr
CROSS JOIN 
	LATERAL UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(pr.toppings, ',')) AS t(value)
JOIN
  (SELECT DISTINCT topping_id, topping_name 
   FROM pizza_toppings) pt
  ON CAST(TRIM(t.value) AS INTEGER) = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY pr.pizza_id, t.value, pt.topping_name
ORDER BY pr.pizza_id;


SELECT *
FROM clean_toppings;

```

--Create a temp table new_recipes to separate toppings into multiple rows
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS new_recipes;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE new_recipes AS
SELECT 
  pr.pizza_id,
  CAST(TRIM(nr.toppings) AS INTEGER) AS topping_id
FROM pizza_recipes AS pr
LEFT JOIN LATERAL UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(pr.toppings, ',')) AS nr(toppings) ON true;


SELECT *
FROM new_recipes
```

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
```sql
WITH Ingredients_CTE AS (
    SELECT nr.pizza_id, pn.pizza_name, pt.topping_name
    FROM new_recipes AS nr
    JOIN pizza_toppings AS pt
        ON nr.topping_id = pt.topping_id
    JOIN pizza_names AS pn
        ON pn.pizza_id = nr.pizza_id
    ORDER BY pn.pizza_name
)
SELECT pizza_name, STRING_AGG(topping_name, ', ') as str_topping_name
FROM Ingredients_CTE
GROUP BY pizza_name;
```
 pizza_name | std_topping_names
:----------:|:-------------:
 Meatlovers |BBQ Sauce, Pepperoni, Cheese, Salami, Chicken, Bacon, Mushrooms, Beef
 Vegetarian |Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomatoes
 
 ---
2. What was the most commonly added extra?
```sql
SELECT  COUNT (tc.extras) extras_count, pt.topping_name		
FROM pizza_toppings AS pt
JOIN temp_customer_orders AS tc  
  ON tc.extras = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY extras, topping_name
ORDER BY extras_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
 
```
  extras_count | topping_name
:------:|:-------------:
  4     | Bacon
  
---
3. What was the most common exclusion?
```sql
SELECT  COUNT (tc.exclusions) exclusion_count,  pt.topping_name		
FROM pizza_toppings AS pt
JOIN temp_customer_orders AS tc  
  ON tc.exclusions = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY exclusions, topping_name
ORDER BY exclusion_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
  exclusion_count	 | topping_name
:------:|:--------------:
 4 	| Cheese
 
---
4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
   - Meat Lovers
   - Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
   - Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
   - Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers

To solve this question: 
- Add a record_id to the customer_orders table to select each ordered pizza more easily
- I then created temp tables, see the *Creating Temp Tables* section above for the queries used
- Create 3 CTEs: extras_cte, exclusions_cte, and union_cte combining two tables
- Use the union_cte to LEFT JOIN with the customer_orders table and JOIN with the pizza_name table
- Use the CONCAT_WS with STRING_AGG to get the result

--adding record id column
```sql
ALTER TABLE customer_orders
ADD COLUMN record_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY

SELECT *
FROM customer_orders;
```

```SQL
WITH CTE_Extras AS
(SELECT
ce.record_id,
'Extra ' || STRING_AGG(t.topping_name, ', ') AS record_options
FROM clean_extras AS ce
JOIN pizza_toppings AS t
  ON ce.extra_id = t.topping_id
GROUP BY ce.record_id),

CTE_Exclusions AS 
(SELECT
ce.record_id,
'Exclude ' || STRING_AGG(t.topping_name, ', ') AS record_options
FROM clean_exclusions AS ce
JOIN pizza_toppings AS t
  ON ce.exclusions_id = t.topping_id
GROUP BY ce.record_id),

CTE_Union AS 
(SELECT * FROM CTE_Extras
UNION
SELECT * FROM CTE_Exclusions)

SELECT
c.record_id,
c.order_id,
c.customer_id,
c.pizza_id,
c.order_time,
CONCAT_WS(' - ', p.pizza_name, STRING_AGG(u.record_options, ' - ')) AS pizza_info
FROM customer_orders AS c
LEFT JOIN CTE_Union AS u
  ON c.record_id = u.record_id
JOIN pizza_names p
  ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY
c.record_id,
c.order_id,
c.customer_id,
c.pizza_id,
c.order_time,
p.pizza_name
ORDER BY record_id;
```

5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
  - For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"

To solve this question:
- Create a CTE in which each line displays an ingredient for an ordered pizza (add '2x' for extras and remove exclusions as well)
  - Use CONCAT and STRING_AGG to get the result

~~~sql
WITH ingredients AS (
  SELECT 
    co.record_id,
    co.order_id,
    co.customer_id,
    co.pizza_id,
    co.order_time,
    pn.pizza_name,
    CASE 
      WHEN t.topping_id::int IN 
	( SELECT eb.extra_id 
        FROM extrasBreak eb 
        WHERE eb.record_id = co.record_id) THEN '2x ' || pt.topping_name
      ELSE pt.topping_name
    END AS topping
  FROM 
    pizza_runner.customer_orders co
    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn 
      ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_recipes pr 
      ON co.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id
    LEFT JOIN unnest(string_to_array(pr.toppings, ',')) AS t(topping_id) 
      ON TRUE
    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt 
      ON t.topping_id::int = pt.topping_id
  WHERE 
    NOT EXISTS 
	(SELECT 1 
      FROM exclusionsBreak eb 
      WHERE co.record_id = eb.record_id 
      AND pt.topping_id = eb.exclusions_id))
SELECT 
  record_id,
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  pizza_id,
  order_time,
  CONCAT(pizza_name, ': ', STRING_AGG(topping, ', ')) AS ingredients_list
FROM ingredients
GROUP BY 
  record_id, 
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  pizza_id,
  order_time,
  pizza_name
ORDER BY 
  record_id;
~~~

6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?
To solve this question:
- Create a CTE to record the number of times each ingredient was used
  - if extra ingredient, add 2
  - if excluded ingredient, add 0
  - no extras or no exclusions, add 1
~~~sql
WITH frequentIngredients AS (
  SELECT 
    c.record_id,
    t.topping_name,
    CASE
      -- if extra ingredient, add 2
      WHEN t.topping_id IN (
          SELECT extra_id 
          FROM extrasBreak e
          WHERE e.record_id = c.record_id) 
      THEN 2
      -- if excluded ingredient, add 0
      WHEN t.topping_id IN (
          SELECT exclusions_id 
          FROM exclusionsBreak e 
          WHERE c.record_id = e.record_id)
      THEN 0
      -- no extras, no exclusions, add 1
      ELSE 1
    END AS times_used
  FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
  JOIN toppingsBreak t
    ON t.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
  JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names p
    ON p.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
)

SELECT 
  topping_name,
  SUM(times_used) AS times_used 
FROM frequentIngredients
GROUP BY topping_name
ORDER BY times_used DESC;
~~~
  topping_name  | times_used
:--------------:|:--------------:
  Mushrooms     | 13
  Bacon         | 13
  Chicken       | 11
  Cheese        | 11
  Pepperoni     | 10
  Salami        | 10
  Beef          | 10
  BBQ Sauce     | 9 
  Tomatoes      | 4
  Onions        | 4
  Peppers       | 4
  Tomato Sauce  | 4
